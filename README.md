# K2Lin_Crypto_MKII

The improved version of K2Lin Crypto has a nice UI. The same is the implementation of RSA encryption on C#.

# Features!

**RSA asymmetric encryption - with OAEP padding**

Main function of this program ♪(´▽｀)

Which allows you to transmit confidential data in an insecure transmission environment.

**AES symmetric encryption - with 256-bit encryption**

Perfect for chatting with friends! (｡･∀･)ﾉﾞ

**Image Steganography Tech - with Least Significant Bit**

Hide your messages in a image!

Very stealthy, keep it cool!☆⌒(*＾-゜)v THX!!

**Multi-language support**

(currently supports Chinese and English) o(*￣▽￣*)ブ

**Save and import RSA key pairs.**

Allowing you to keep a static RSA key pair. Until you need it.(optional two-step verification encryption for selection.)

**Modern user interface**

Compared with the MKI version of this program, this version adds a modern and beautiful flat UI.
(If you want to add some colors you like, just create a pull request!) ヾ(•ω•`)o

**Unlimited extensible**

If there is a function you need, please put it out in Issues! (｡･∀･)ﾉﾞ
(Or you can code it yourself, and then release the pull request!)

# Instructions!

**At present, this section still needs volunteers to fill up the pictures** ヾ(≧▽≦*)o
