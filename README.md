# K2Lin_Crypto_MKII

The improved version of K2Lin Crypto has a nice UI. The same is the implementation of RSA encryption on C#.

# Features!

**RSA asymmetric encryption**

Main function of this program ♪(´▽｀)

which allows you to transmit confidential data in an insecure transmission environment.

**Multi-language support**

(currently supports Chinese and English) o(*￣▽￣*)ブ

**Save and import key pairs.**

allowing you to keep a static key pair. Until you need it.(optional two-step verification encryption for selection.)

**Modern user interface**

Compared with the MKI version of this program, this version adds a modern and beautiful flat UI.
(If you want to add some colors you like, just create a branch!) ヾ(•ω•`)o

**Unlimited extensible**

If there is a function you need, please put it out in Issues! (｡･∀･)ﾉﾞ
(Or you can code it yourself, and then release the branch!)

# Instructions!

**At present, this section still needs volunteers to fill up the pictures** ヾ(≧▽≦*)o
